&#8220;Force Multiplication through IT Automation&#8221; comes from the military, where a force multiplier is an attribute such as technology or experience that allows a small force to accomplish the same results of a force many times larger. In information technology, automation tools such as PowerShell allow an individual IT professional to be just as effective as a large staff performing tasks manually.
