This VBscript prompts for a computer name or IP Address, connects to that systemâ€™s registry over the network and changes the scforceoption key to allow for immediate logon without a smart card. A PowerShell GUI version of this script can be found [here]({{"/bypass-smart-card-logon-using-remote-registry-in-powershell/"}}), and there is also an [updated version]({{"/toggle-smart-card-logon-requirement-with-set-scforceoption/"}}) that works like a PowerShell cmdlet.

Many organizations now require CAC cards or another type of smart card to logon to workstations. A common way to enforce this is to use the `Interactive logon: Require smart card` group policy setting. When there is a problem with smart card authentication, this setting makes it difficult for troubleshooting.

        WScript.Echo "Registry Key changed on " & strComputer
End if

Set objReg = Nothing
