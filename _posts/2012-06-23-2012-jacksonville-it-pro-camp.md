It was great meeting so many new people interested in PowerShell at the [Jacksonville IT Pro Camp](https://itpro.camp/) last weekend. All of the presenters at these events are volunteers, so it's an awesome feeling to have people come up and say "thank you for your session, it was really useful!" The IT Pro Camps are an opportunity to connect with other IT Professionals and hear people talk about what they're passionate about. It's also a wonderful opportunity for beginning speakers to develop sessions and gain confidence communicating technical information to others.

I've uploaded the [transcript](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YtyYbey7wpOGKmqIYeZRIseB1RN1acqE) from my PowerShell for Beginners session, and the [slide deck](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FchxCcehGyR5O6LIQd-KbTHmsgouOeIO) from my Introduction to PowerShell Remoting session. 

If you want to learn more about PowerShell, a great place to start is the [Hey, Scripting Guy!](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/) blog from Microsoft's scripting guy Ed Wilson. If it can be done with PowerShell, Ed has probably written about it. I also have a list of [free PowerShell eBooks](/list-of-free-powershell-ebooks/) available, along with a [list of paid books](/list-of-powershell-books/) on various PowerShell topics. I also listed several resources in my post on the [Jacksonville SQL Saturday](/resources-from-sql-saturday-130/).

Thanks for coming out on Saturday, and I hope to see you again at a future event!
