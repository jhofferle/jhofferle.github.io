It was great meeting so many new people interested in PowerShell at the <a href="https://itpro.camp/" target="_blank">Jacksonville IT Pro Camp</a> last weekend. All of the presenters at these events are volunteers, so it&#8217;s an awesome feeling to have people come up and say &#8220;thank you for your session, it was really useful!&#8221; The IT Pro Camps are an opportunity to connect with other IT Professionals and hear people talk about what they&#8217;re passionate about. It&#8217;s also a wonderful opportunity for beginning speakers to develop sessions and gain confidence communicating technical information to others.

I&#8217;ve uploaded the [transcript](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YtyYbey7wpOGKmqIYeZRIseB1RN1acqE) from my PowerShell for Beginners session, and the [slide deck](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FchxCcehGyR5O6LIQd-KbTHmsgouOeIO) from my Introduction to PowerShell Remoting session. 

If you want to learn more about PowerShell, a great place to start is the <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/" target="_blank">Hey, Scripting Guy!</a> blog from Microsoft&#8217;s scripting guy Ed Wilson. If it can be done with PowerShell, Ed has probably written about it. I also have a list of <a href="https://www.hofferle.com/list-of-free-powershell-ebooks/" title="List of Free PowerShell eBooks" target="_blank">free PowerShell eBooks</a> available, along with a <a href="https://www.hofferle.com/list-of-powershell-books/" title="List of PowerShell Books" target="_blank">list of paid books</a> on various PowerShell topics. I also listed several resources in my post on the <a href="https://www.hofferle.com/resources-from-sql-saturday-130/" title="Resources from SQL Saturday #130" target="_blank">Jacksonville SQL Saturday</a>.

Thanks for coming out on Saturday, and I hope to see you again at a future event!
