This weekend was my first SQL Saturday, and I was very happy to have my session on PowerShell remoting selected. The SQL community is an amazing bunch of people, and I&#8217;m glad these opportunities for sharing knowledge and making friends exist. I want to thank Pam Shaw and all the other organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and speakers that helped make this event a success.
