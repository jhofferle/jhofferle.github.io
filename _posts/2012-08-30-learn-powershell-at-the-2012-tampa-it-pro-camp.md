I will be presenting [PowerShell for Beginners](https://itpro.camp/ "PowerShell for Beginners") at the [Tampa IT Pro Camp](https://itpro.camp/ "2012 Tampa IT Pro Camp") on September 22. My session will be the first of an entire track dedicated to PowerShell that includes presentations by two PowerShell MVPs and a Microsoft senior premier field engineer. This is an excellent opportunity to get some free training and network with other information technology professionals in Florida. I hope to see you there!
