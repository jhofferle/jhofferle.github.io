Numlock status on a Windows computer is controlled from three places. The BIOS controls the numlock until Windows is booted. At the logon screen, the numlock status along with settings such as the screensaver are loaded from the .DEFAULT user profile. After a user logs on, the settings are loaded from that particular userâ€™s profile.

This script prompts for a computer name and then changes the InitialKeyboardIndicators value so that the numlock is on at the Ctrl+Alt+Del logon screen.
