Remember to use <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113309" title="Get-Command" target="_blank">Get-Command</a> to find cmdlets, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113316" title="Get-Help" target="_blank">Get-Help</a> to find out how to use them, and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113322" title="Get-Member" target="_blank">Get-Member</a> to find out what the returned objects can do.

If you liked what you saw and want to learn more, there are many resources available for learning PowerShell. I have a <a href="http://www.hofferle.com/list-of-free-powershell-ebooks/" title="List of Free PowerShell eBooks" target="_blank">list of free PowerShell eBooks</a> which is a good place to start. I also have a <a href="http://www.hofferle.com/list-of-powershell-books/" title="List of PowerShell Books" target="_blank">list of paid PowerShell books</a>. For someone completely new to PowerShell or someone that prefers a very structured learning approach, I suggest _Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches_ by Don Jones. Be sure to check out the additional resources at the <a href="http://morelunches.com/2012/11/01/learn-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-2nd-ed/" target="_blank">book&#8217;s website</a>, and take advantage of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6D474E721138865A&#038;feature=view_all" target="_blank">companion videos</a> Don has made available on YouTube. Someone with a scripting or programming background that&#8217;s looking for a solid reference book would do well with Bruce Payette&#8217;s book _PowerShell in Action_. This is a very detailed look at how PowerShell works and why certain decisions were made when designing the language.

Many <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/powershell" target="_blank">PowerShell videos</a> are available at Channel 9, including the PowerShell sessions from <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd" target="_blank">TechEd events</a>. Don Jones has a <a href="http://youtu.be/7fFEV8xawx0" target="_blank">four hour sample</a> of a training class uploaded to Youtube, and Jeff Hicks has a <a href="http://www.trainsignal.com/Windows-PowerShell-Training.aspx" target="_blank">series of videos</a> from TrainSignal. 

Have a long commute and need something to listen to? Try downloading some podcasts from the <a href="http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">PowerScripting Podcast</a>. Last week Michiel Wories, the Principal Architect and Lead Developer of SQL Server, was talking about SQL Server 2012.

Most of these resources focus on PowerShell in general and don&#8217;t get specific on SQL Server. For some examples on how PowerShell is used by SQL Server experts, I suggest reading the blogs from <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/allen_white/default.aspx" target="_blank">Allen White</a>, <a href="http://sqlvariant.com/" target="_blank">Aaron Nelson</a>, <a href="http://sev17.com/" target="_blank">Chad Miller</a>, and <a href="http://www.maxtblog.com/" target="_blank">Max Trinidad</a>.

For some more ideas on how PowerShell can be useful for a Database Administrtor, check out the <a href="http://sqlpsx.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">SQL Server PowerShell Extensions</a>. SQLPSX is an open source project for working with ADO.NET, SMO, Agent, RMO, SSIS, SQL script files, PBM, Oracle and MySQL and using Powershell ISE as a SQL and Oracle query tool.

There is a massive amount of information available, but hopefully this is enough to get you started. The PowerShell community is very active and close-knit in the way the SQL community is. Send someone an email, ask a question in a forum, or throw the twitter tag #PowerShell on your tweets, and you&#8217;re very likely to get pointed in the right direction.
