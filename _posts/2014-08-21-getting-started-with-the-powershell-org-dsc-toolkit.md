![image-left](/assets/img/TrainingRoom.jpg){: .align-left}Tonight at the [Tampa PowerShell User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Tampa-PowerShell-UserGroup/) I'm presenting a session on Desired State Configuration and how the PowerShell.org DSC tooling can be utilized. This is the framework initially written by [Steven Murawski](https://stevenmurawski.com/) to manage the Windows servers at StackExchange.
