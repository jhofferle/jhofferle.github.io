![image-left](/assets/img/Cheat_Sheet.jpg){: .align-left}Getting through the inital learning curve of using PowerShell for administration tasks can be frustrating. This is especially true when someone is on the phone waiting for a password reset and you're reading through the online help or flipping through a book. I've had enough of these situations that I created a quick reference with a handful of useful tasks from the [Quest ActiveRoles Management Shell](https://www.oneidentity.com/products/active-roles/). Even in the digital age I like having a printed page that I can glance at when I don't quite remember how to pipe a couple cmdlets together to change a group membership. If you're trying to promote PowerShell in your own organization, ask others about their common tasks and create your own cheat sheet. People are very good at creating obstacles when they don't want to learn something new. Sometimes printing out a few notes is all it takes to remove one of those obstacles.
