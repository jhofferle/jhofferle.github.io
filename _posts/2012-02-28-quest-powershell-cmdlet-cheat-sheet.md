![image-left](/assets/img/Cheat_Sheet.jpg){: .align-left}Getting through the inital learning curve of using PowerShell for administration tasks can be frustrating. This is especially true when someone is on the phone waiting for a password reset and you&#8217;re reading through the online help or flipping through a book. I&#8217;ve had enough of these situations that I created a quick reference with a handful of useful tasks from the <a href="http://www.quest.com/powershell/activeroles-server.aspx" title="Quest ActiveRoles Management Shell" target="_blank">Quest ActiveRoles Management Shell</a>. Even in the digital age I like having a printed page that I can glance at when I don&#8217;t quite remember how to pipe a couple cmdlets together to change a group membership. If you&#8217;re trying to promote PowerShell in your own organization, ask others about their common tasks and create your own cheat sheet. People are very good at creating obstacles when they don&#8217;t want to learn something new. Sometimes printing out a few notes is all it takes to remove one of those obstacles.
