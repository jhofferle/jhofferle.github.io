![image-left](/assets/img/Honorary-Scripting-Guy_large.png){: .align-left}This week I was selected as an [Honorary Scripting Guy](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2012/11/04/announcing-the-2012-honorary-scripting-guys/). The list includes some of the top authors and trainers in the PowerShell world, and it's a real honor to be included among them. Many of us spend a lot of time blogging, writing articles, or speaking about PowerShell, often on our own time. It's always nice to hear about how our contributions to the community are worthwhile. Thank you Ed Wilson, and congratulations to my fellow recipients!
