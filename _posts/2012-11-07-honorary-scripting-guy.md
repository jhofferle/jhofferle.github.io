![image-left](/assets/img/Honorary-Scripting-Guy_large.png){: .align-left}This week I was selected as an <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/11/04/announcing-the-2012-honorary-scripting-guys.aspx" title="Announcing the 2012 Honorary Scripting Guys" target="_blank">Honorary Scripting Guy</a>. The list includes some of the top authors and trainers in the PowerShell world, and it&#8217;s a real honor to be included among them. Many of us spend a lot of time blogging, writing articles, or speaking about PowerShell, often on our own time. It&#8217;s always nice to hear about how our contributions to the community are worthwhile. Thank you Ed Wilson, and congratulations to my fellow recipients!
