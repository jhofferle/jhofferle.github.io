Microsoft released the Windows 8 developer preview last night, which includes PowerShell version 3! The IT Pros that couldn&#8217;t sleep last night are reporting hundreds of new cmdlets and functions over what&#8217;s available in Windows 7. The Windows 8 developer preview can be downloaded at the [Windows Dev Center](http://dev.windows.com/).
