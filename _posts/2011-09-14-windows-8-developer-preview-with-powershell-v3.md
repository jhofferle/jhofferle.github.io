Microsoft released the Windows 8 developer preview last night, which includes PowerShell version 3! The IT Pros that couldn't sleep last night are reporting hundreds of new cmdlets and functions over what's available in Windows 7. The Windows 8 developer preview can be downloaded at the [Windows Dev Center](http://dev.windows.com/).
